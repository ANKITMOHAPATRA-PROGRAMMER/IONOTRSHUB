Hey can you please add the label of hacktoberfest-accepted on my previous pull request *Converted to dark theme, added multiple styles*, so that it will be valid for hacktoberfest 2021.
This will really help me in completion of hacktoberfest.

I tried contacting you through message, but there was no reply. So I had to create this PR.

It would be really helpgul to me if that tag gets added my previous PR.
